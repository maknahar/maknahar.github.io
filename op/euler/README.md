This is my attempt to solve first problem of the euler project.

A project in The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/javascript-basics).

From Project Euler.net :

    If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
    Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
