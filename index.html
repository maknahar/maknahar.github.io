        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am passionate about my work and always eager to learn new things, technical or otherwise. While I enjoy
            all aspects of my job, I think my favorite stage of a project is when we face any architectural issue that
            need clever and innovative thinking to solve. As we go through collaborative process, the ideas start to
            flow and that’s always the fun part.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m always interested in hearing from former colleagues, managers, or just interesting creative folk,
            so feel free to contact me if you’d like to connect.
